REQ-1 header branding looks updated to text-based “SHAMMAH” with no visible <img> in the shown header snippet, but the diff summary does not conclusively demonstrate removal of all remaining references to the Butterfly Wellness wordmark in the header branding code path; one updated summary file still claims the asset is used in the landing page header.",
